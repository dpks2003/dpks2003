## Hi there 👋
Hello! I’m Deepak Sharda, an electronics engineer who spends most of his time working with FPGAs — both professionally and as a hobby. In my free time, I love exploring all domains of electronics (well… maybe not RF, that stuff’s still a bit tough 😅).

I enjoy everything about hardware — from designing architectures for ASICs to writing firmware for microcontrollers — and I’m always trying to get hands-on with as many aspects of it as I can.

Right now, I’m affiliated with [Vicharak](https://vicharak.in/) Computers as an FPGA Engineer, where I work on accelerating algorithms on FPGAs. Some of the notable projects I’ve worked on include:

* Gati ML Accelerator – a general-purpose FPGA-based machine learning accelerator

* [Shrike](https://github.com/vicharak-in/shrike_fpga) – a small, open-source FPGA development board

Outside of work, I spend time tinkering with different kinds of hardware and occasionally writing blogs to share my experiments and learnings.
