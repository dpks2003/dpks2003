## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an FPGA Developer working on heterogeneous computing solutions that blend CPU + FPGA acceleration for ML workloads. My focus is on building vendor-agnostic, general-purpose ML accelerators with ONNX model support, flexible operator coverage, and efficient memory handling.

ðŸ”§ Current interests:

* Custom FPGA architectures (Efinix Trion â†’ Titanium, PolarFire SoC)
* Hardware/software co-design

In my free time I work on side project as well maybe i will list them on here soon.
